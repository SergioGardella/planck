Training Wheel keycaps for the Planck keyboard, as seen on Reddit,
https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/7ztupy/training_wheels/

Order your own set here,

Don't forget to set the keycap colors!  There should be 32 light grey, 13 dark grey, and one orange, and one blue (although, really, you can do whatever you want).
All the black keys are unused (the only useful ones are the six R3-profile ones in the top-right).
