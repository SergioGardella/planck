Don't forget to set the keycap colors!  There should be 32 light grey, 13 dark grey, and one orange, and one blue (although, really, you can do whatever you want).
All the black keys are unused (the only useful ones are the six R3-profile ones in the top-right).

This shows the keycap heights of the different rows (important if you want to move the keys around).

Notably, "F" and "J" are the homing keys (they're R2-profile with lines), and the "Enter" key has the dot.

If you don't mind the bottom row not being all R1-profile, you can can also print the 61-key set,
